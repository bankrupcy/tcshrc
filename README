This package has a set of configuration files for the TCSH (csh) shell.
It makes heavy use of the nice features of TCSH.

To use it, you need to be running the TCSH shell.
Check your appropriate line in /etc/passwd to see if you run TCSH.
If not, you may be able to use "chsh" to change to "/bin/tcsh".

If you would like to use the configuration files in DEMO mode, I suggest
the following.

1. Open a new terminal window (or a new virtual console).
2. Enter the directory with this package (where this file resides).
3. Execute "setenv HOME `pwd`" to set the HOME variable to the current
   directory.
4. Then do: "source .tcshrc" to activate the new configuration.
5. Now you are ready! You will see something like:

Fri Aug 31 14:22:22 GMT 2000
/home/user/tcshrc/tcshrc-0.3
root has logged on pts/0 from :0.
root has logged on pts/1 from :0.
user has logged on tty1 from local.
pc90:/home/user/tcshrc/tcshrc-0.3%  <- cursor is at this position, waiting.

Now read the FAQ file on the new functionality and how to use it properly.

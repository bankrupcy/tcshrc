This package has a set of configuration files for the TCSH (csh) shell.
It makes heavy use of the nice usability features of TCSH.

To use it, you need to be running the TCSH shell.
Check your appropriate line in /etc/passwd to see if you run TCSH.
If not, you may be able to use "chsh" to change your shell to "/bin/tcsh".

There is a Makefile in the project directory. Type “make” to view 
the installation options.

Now read the FAQ file on the new functionality and how to use it properly.

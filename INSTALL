I have put a "Makefile", type "make" to see the options there.
Essentially, the Makefile does what the following suggests.

NEW NEW NEW

To install the new .tcshrc.* files, you should first take a backup
of your original .tcshrc file, if there is any.
Then, copy the .tcshrc* files from this directory to your home directory.

A. To make a backup of your existing .tcshrc file

% cd
% cp .tcshrc .tcshrc.ORIGINAL

B. To install the new .tcshrc* files

% cd tcshrc-0.x/
% cp .tcshrc* ~/

Exit the shell and logon again (or open a new window).
